I‚Äôm a passionate and results-driven Senior Full Stack Developer with over 5 years of experience architecting, developing, and delivering high-impact software solutions across financial services, insurance, and enterprise technology domains.

My core strengths lie in designing scalable, cloud-native applications using Java, Spring Boot, Angular, React.js, and AWS. From re-architecting legacy monoliths into modular microservices to leading mission-critical cloud migration and modernization initiatives, I bring both deep technical know-how and a strategic business mindset to the table.

I have a strong foundation in:

üõ†Ô∏è Full SDLC: From requirement gathering and system design to deployment and production support.

‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud & DevOps: AWS (Lambda, ECS, Aurora), Docker, Jenkins, Terraform, GitHub Actions.

üß© Modern Architectures: Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), CI/CD pipelines, and RESTful API ecosystems.

üîê Enterprise-readiness: Secure coding practices, static code analysis (SonarQube), compliance with PCI DSS, and audit support.

I take pride in delivering solutions that not only perform well at scale but also solve real business problems‚Äîwhether it's reducing infrastructure costs, improving system uptime, or enhancing the user experience.

Beyond code, I‚Äôm known for:

Leading cross-functional Agile teams with empathy and accountability.

Mentoring junior developers and promoting clean code, peer reviews, and innovation.

Navigating high-pressure production issues and ensuring business continuity with observability and incident response best practices.

I‚Äôm always exploring new tools and methodologies that improve efficiency and resilience‚Äîfrom GitHub Copilot to AI-driven testing and performance profiling tools.
